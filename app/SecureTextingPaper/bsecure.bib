                 of cryptography. We note that the easily remembered key
                 is very amenable to attack, and that these rules, as
                 all others, should be questioned before placing trust
                 in them: \begin{itemize} \item ciphertext should be
                 unbreakable in practice \item the cryptosystem should
                 be convenient for the correspondents \item the key
                 should be easily remembered and changeable \item the
                 ciphertext should be transmissible by telegraph \item
                 the cipher apparatus should be easily portable \item
                 the cipher machine should be relatively easily to use
                 \end{itemize} ''",
