\section{Introduction}
Providing secure communication can be a difficult task for a variety of reasons. Common sense
suggests that ideal technological solutions should be easy to use, reliable, trustworthy, and
should present minimal barriers to adoption . In this paper, we present a mobile application
developed on the Android platform that meets all of the above requirements to provide secure
SMS communication using any device that allows standard SMS text messages and which possesses
Bluetooth capabilities. Our app uses end-to-end encryption, and does not require the use of a
separate server to facilitate communication or key exchange.

1. There is a real need for secure communication. NSA Edward Snowden, etc.

2. Servers are prone to attacks, and are owned by other people. Companies have been compelled
to share user data by court order.

3. SMS is basic technology enabled by all communication providers. Does not require Internet
access, either for server or communication itself. Since encrypted, it's okay that third party
transmits and sees the data.

4. Open Source allows anyone to view our source code. \cite{Kerckhoffs:1883:CMF,shannon-otp}

The major contributions of this paper are as follows:
1. We provide a secure, SMS-based texting app that provides end-to-end encryption, does not require
an additional server for key exchange, and which is open source so that its security can be
verified by anyone concerned. While several existing tools provide some, or many,  of these
features, we are not aware of any that provide all.

2. Our app provides a high degree of configurability and automates most of the tedious aspects of
key exchanges, thereby providing a low barrier for adoption. We believe this will make the app more
useful to a wider variety of people.
