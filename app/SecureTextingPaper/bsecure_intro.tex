\section{Introduction}
Providing secure communication can be a difficult task for a variety of reasons. Common sense suggests that ideal technological solutions should be easy to use, reliable, trustworthy, and should present minimal barriers to adoption . In this paper, we present a mobile application developed on the Android platform that meets all of the above requirements to provide secure SMS communication using any device that allows standard SMS text messages and which possesses Bluetooth capabilities. Our app uses end-to-end encryption, and does not require the use of a separate server to facilitate communication or key exchange.

1. There is a real need for secure communication. NSA Edward Snowden, etc.

2. Servers are prone to attacks, and are owned by other people. Companies have been compelled to share user data by court order.

3. SMS is basic technology enabled by all communication providers. Does not require Internet access (either for server or communication itself). Since encrypted, it's okay that third party transmits and sees the data.

4. Open Source allows anyone to view our source code.

The \textit{proceedings} are the records of a conference.
ACM seeks to give these conference by-products a uniform,
high-quality appearance.  To do this, ACM has some rigid
requirements for the format of the proceedings documents: there
is a specified format (balanced  double columns), a specified
set of fonts (Arial or Helvetica and Times Roman) in
certain specified sizes (for instance, 9 point for body copy),
a specified live area (18 $\times$ 23.5 cm [7" $\times$ 9.25"]) centered on
the page, specified size of margins (1.9 cm [0.75"]) top, (2.54 cm [1"]) bottom
and (1.9 cm [.75"]) left and right; specified column width
(8.45 cm [3.33"]) and gutter size (.83 cm [.33"]).

The good news is, with only a handful of manual
settings\footnote{Two of these, the {\texttt{\char'134 numberofauthors}}
and {\texttt{\char'134 alignauthor}} commands, you have
already used; another, {\texttt{\char'134 balancecolumns}}, will
be used in your very last run of \LaTeX\ to ensure
balanced column heights on the last page.}, the \LaTeX\ document
class file handles all of this for you.

The remainder of this document is concerned with showing, in
the context of an ``actual'' document, the \LaTeX\ commands
specifically available for denoting the structure of a
proceedings paper, rather than with giving rigorous descriptions
or explanations of such commands.
