\section{Design Implementation}
This is a placeholder for some introductory paragraph to our design.

\subsection{Key Exchange}

\subsubsection{Bluetooth Key Generation}
When users begin the process of creating keys to secure their communications, they must pair their android devices together with Bluetooth.

Our text messages are encrypted using 256-bit keys. The keys are generated using the built-in Java crypto and security package classes configured to run in
``DH'' (Diffie-Hellman) mode. The keys created are given as byte arrays; however, for the sake of simplicity and storage the keys are encoded as a Base64 String.

The keys are used to encrypt text messages before they are sent, and then again to decrypt the message on the other end using the same key.
\subsection{Information Storage and Control}

All persistent information generated by the application is stored in SQLite servers. Persistent information in this context refers to any keys generated, contact-specific settings, general settings, uses left per key, and sequence number information.


\subsubsection{BSecure Databases}
We stored all our important values for maintaining each BSecure associated contact
into a database. The values stored in this database table are used to decide what key to use for that
contact.

Refer to Table \ref{table:contacttable} for the row layout of our SQL database.

\begin{table*}

\caption{Contact Table Design}
\label{table:contacttable}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline
Contact\_ID&CURRENT\_SEQUENCE\_NUM&MAX\_SEQUENCE\_NUM&TOTAL\_KEYS&USES\_LEFT&USES\_MAX\\ \hline\end{tabular}
\end{table*}

\subsection{Use of Text Message Headers}
We appended a header to the beginning of encrypted text messages to flag to the receiving application that
the incomming message is a BSecure encrypted message.
