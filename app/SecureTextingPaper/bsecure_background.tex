Short Message Service security has quickly become a topic of discussion in recent years.
Many articles have begone to propose protocols such as SMS Security\cite{SmsSecurity} and Secure SMS\cite{SecureSms} to modify existing technology to provide end-to-end encryption to SMS.
We take a different approach by designing and implementing a application level solution to SMS security.

PK-SIM\cite{PkSim} also included the use of a third party certificate authority.
Taking a decentralized design means users never have to rely on the integrity or strength of a third party and their systems. Key exchanges are done locally with a Bluetooth connection.
Users can be sure they are exchanging with the right person, and keys never leave the local device.

There are existing works that don't require modification to existing protocols like Bleep\cite{bleep}.
BitTorrent released Bleep in May 2015 as a end-to-end peer-to-peer encryption messaging app.

However such options are closed source. We aim to provide a freely available open source solution.
